###Docs
- how to use another theme, basically replace templates
- what is the difference between pages and posts

rstblog

I didn't like that you had to create the year month day folders yourself
should be able to have a directory of all posts
meta tags? description author etc
why do I need all of the files in the _templates folder? Why can't I just override by having one or using default by not
should serve the non build version or run build right before serving
if you change layout.html you have to delete build in order to see changes, just running build will not over right since those files didn't change.
no .yml and how to access those variables? use in templates
next shouldn't be a link on last page of archive
No Docs
